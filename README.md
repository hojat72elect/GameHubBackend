# GameHubDataBase

This repository contains all the backend services I have created
around <a href="https://github.com/hojat72elect/GameHub">GameHub</a> app:

* <b>bots</b> directory contains various bots that I have made for advertising about the app.

* <b>GameHubDataBase</b> makes a database of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/news/">GameSpot news</a> to be used as
  the database of GameHub in the future. Here I'm trying to make up my own data warehouse, so I can use it later as a
  backend of my own to that app.
